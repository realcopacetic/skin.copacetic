**2.6.1**
- Added a three second delay when entering movies or home windows before trailers will autoplay

**2.5.8**

**2.5.6**
- New attempted fix for Infoscreen Path Tracer Button bug (see below). Rearchitected logic of the loop so it's no longer reliant on a timed delay

**2.5.5**
- Fixed bug in tvshow infoscreen widgets where 'Next up' and 'More episodes from Season X' widgets would both display on top of each other
- Fixed bug in 'More from Actor Name' widget where it was not removing the current item if widget was opened from an episode infoscreen. This fix is in conjunction with a fix in script.copacetic.helper (1.1.5).
-  Attempted fix for bug in Infoscreen Path Tracer Button that was not resolved in previous update on less powerful hardware, where the container takes too long to update on the exit route from ContainerPath_02 to ContainerPath_01. Previously when control 6001 received focus, it would only pause if Container.IsUpdating. Theory is that it was receiving focus before the container update began and so redirecting back to the infoscreen for the same item before the container update had completed. Now the condition for the delay is set to true to hopefully give the container update time to begin. Once it begins, the Container Update Bounce Test will proceed to check every 100ms if the update is finished, before redirecting to the updated infoscreen. --> To be tested on different devices...

**2.5.4**
- Improved animations for gridview border
- Fixed label for visualisation layout in skin settings
- Fixed stripview variable label in global search https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/181
- Fixed bug in infoscreen navigation that was causing navigation to break because !String.IsEqual(Container(3203).ListItem.Label,ListItem.Label) was evaluating to true even when Container(3203) was empty
- Fixed a bug causing some infoscreen widget artwork not to dim when dialog window was open on top, e.g. shutdownmenu
- Fixed a bug causing background colour to stay black on infoscreen widgets when Light theme selected and navigating to infoscreen from a Billboard view home widget
- New WB logo
- New DC logo

- Fixed time widget label colour when showing shutdown menu on top of a home screen widget with Light background theme enabled
- Added container transition between Album and Album disc screen
- Adjusted fade delay times to be consistent between home widget details and breadcrumb label
- Fixed loginscreen background with library fallbacks as script is not loaded until this screen is bypassed
- Fixed a bug in navigation between infoscreens where clicking on an item from an infoscreen to load a new instance of the infoscreen for the new item, then going back, would not result in returning to the previous item's infoscreen. This required adding a tiny delay to the container update bounce check, as it may have been evaluating too quickly.
- Removed season_info_monitor timer and replaced with script.copacetic.helper monitoring
- Fixed infoscreen path tracer when starting from an episode in a widget
- Fixed infoscreen widgets for Seasons view

**2.5.3**
- Disabled debugging

**2.5.2**
- Fixed a bug in translations file https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/183
- Fixed slides for Grid Horizontal layout 
- Added visibility condition to seek label https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/187

**2.5.1**
- Fixed bug where square widgets were showing fanart even when a thumbnail was available https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/179
- Fixed an animation bug when quick transitions are selected caused by the fact that the content switching scroll time was reduced but some scrolling animations in Strip and Showcase are hardcoded. Now the scrolling speed is the same for these views as the default transitions, but there is no longer a delay before the content appears, so it still feels quicker. Choosing to disable scrolling animations entirely still reduces the scroll speed to 0 for these views.
- Fixed a bug in the new Time widget preventing the weather information from correctly displaying

**2.5.0**
- Added option to change transparency of video player overlay (Settings > Copacetic > Backgrounds > 'OSD background brightness during video playback')
- Fixed bug in screen to choose preferred classification system (Settings > Copacetic > Customisations > Preferred classification ratings). Previously wrong labels were showing up in the dialog screen that opens https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/173
- Fixed bug in breadcrumb label colour when Addonbrowser window open and repository list is 
- Added fallback for TV shows info label when ListItem.Property(unwatched episodes) is unavailable
- Fixed animation glitch in artwork fadediffuse when a dialog window e.g. Context Menu is visible on top.
- Transitioned majority of animations to constants
- Fixed background slideshow label - in some scenarios it was showing names that didn't match the artwork currently on display
- Prevented empty progress bar from showing on incomplete movie sets. This was showing as empty because ListItem.IsResumable returns True for collections, but ListItem.PercentPlayed returns empty i.e. 0.
- Fixed glitch in progress bar gradient when navigating through secondary lists on some views
- Disabled Multiart Reset Interrupter on GridView. This interrupter prevents the multiart timer resetting when the container loses focus to items such as the shutdown or view options menu. It's why multiart slideshows can continue in the background when these menus are focused for most views. However, Gridview cannot support this as it is constructed using a default panel, meaning that the focuslayout disappears whenever these other menus take focus. Without disabling the Reset Interruptor, multiart will be visible, then it will disappear if you bring up the shutdown menu, then it will immediately reappear after the menu is closed. This can be jarring so it's better to let the multiart timer reset and start counting again from 0 when gridview loses focus.
- Added progress bar and remaining movies indicator for sets that aren't fully watched using a script.copacetic.helper script.
- Improved accuracy and efficiency of conditional animations for the progress bar unwatched episodes/movies indicator.
- Added ability to speed up animations and window transitions (Settings > Copacetic > General > Speed up animations and window transitions). This feature is currently in beta so further refinement may be necessary following wider testing. When enabled, there is a secondary option to 'Disable all viewtype scroll animations', which will further speed up the main media views by setting scrolltime to 0 https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/73
- Fix for glitch in widget spotlight auto scroll function, which could cause widgets to momentarily disappear 
- Fix for bug where secondary list was sometimes showing Poster art even when 'Prefer keyart' was selected for the specified view and vice versa https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/174
- Added horizontal layouts for Gridview. In Settings > Copacetic > Views > Grid, you can now choose item layout. The options are 'Vertical small', 'Vertical large' and 'Horizontal' https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/180
- Added new Time widget replacing the Clock. Now in Settings > Copacetic > Home > General, you can choose the furniture to include (None / Clock / Clock and Date / Clock, Date and Weather). Note: For weather to be displayed, you must install a weather addon and make sure it's enabled under Settings > Services > Weather https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/177
- Ability to make new Time widget persistent across the entire home screen (Settings > Copacetic > Home > General). In addition, time widget added to settings screens and shutdown menu dialog. https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/178

- Added label to video infoscreen showing end time when infolabel is available https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/168

- Added option to show remaining time rather than item duration in the seekbar (Settings > Copacetic > Customisations > Video Player > 'Prefer time remaining to video duration in seek bar') https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/173  
- Fixed missing label when scrolling embedded lists in Thumbnails layout of List view
- Added fadetime to episode artwork when in ListView Thumbnails layout https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/173

**1.4.0**
- Added option to prefer TMDbHelper plugin if it's enabled as the content source for info screen widgets, under Settings > Copacetic > Customisations > Info screens https://github.com/realcopacetic/skin.copacetic/issues/105
- Fixed bug in window transition animations between home, settings etc to ensure that when background slideshow is the same between two windows, the transition is instantaneous
